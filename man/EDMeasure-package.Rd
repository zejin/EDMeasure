\title{Dependence Measures via Energy Statistics}
\description{
EDMeasure: A package for dependence measures via energy statistics
}
\details{
The EDMeasure package provides measures of mutual dependence and tests of mutual independence, 
independent component analysis methods based on mutual dependence measures,
and measures of conditional mean dependence and tests of conditional mean independence.

The three main parts are:
\itemize{
  \item mutual dependence measures via energy statistics
  \itemize{   
   \item measuring mutual dependence
    \item testing mutual independence
  }
  \item independent component analysis via mutual dependence measures
  \itemize{  
    \item applying mutual dependence measures
    \item initializing local optimization methods
  }
  \item conditional mean dependence measures via energy statistics
  \itemize{ 
    \item measuring conditional mean dependence
    \item testing conditional mean independence
  }
}
}
\section{Mutual Dependence Measures via Energy Statistics}{

\strong{Measuring mutual dependence}

The mutual dependence measures include: 
\itemize{
  \item asymmetric measure \eqn{\mathcal{R}_n} based on distance covariance \eqn{\mathcal{V}_n}
  \item symmetric measure \eqn{\mathcal{S}_n} based on distance covariance \eqn{\mathcal{V}_n}
  \item complete measure \eqn{\mathcal{Q}_n} based on complete V-statistics
  \item simplified complete measure \eqn{\mathcal{Q}_n^\star} based on incomplete V-statistics
  \item asymmetric measure \eqn{\mathcal{J}_n} based on complete measure \eqn{\mathcal{Q}_n}
  \item simplified asymmetric measure \eqn{\mathcal{J}_n^\star} based on simplified complete measure 
    \eqn{\mathcal{Q}_n^\star}
  \item symmetric measure \eqn{\mathcal{I}_n} based on complete measure \eqn{\mathcal{Q}_n}
  \item simplified symmetric measure \eqn{\mathcal{I}_n^\star} based on simplified complete measure 
    \eqn{\mathcal{Q}_n^\star}

\strong{Testing mutual independence}

The mutual independence tests based on the mutual dependence measures are implemented as permutation 
tests.
